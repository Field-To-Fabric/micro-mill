   <td>Fiber wrapping around from trailing wheel.

   <td>Too much pressure on the trailing wheel. 
<p>
The trailing wheel is collecting moisture. 
   </td>
   <td>Reduce pressure on trailing wheels. 
<p>
Apply starch to the trailing wheel. The best practice is to remove the trailing wheel after each use and store it in starch.

   <td>Yarn is highly inconsistent in diameter.

   <td>Drafting wheels are set too far or too close together.

Inconsistent roving/sliver

Roving/sliver is too dry

Loose Coupler

Trailing Wheels are too tight

Roving/sliver is too thick. 
   </td>
   <td>Adjust drafting wheel spacing. 
<p>
Redraft/condense the roving/sliver. 
<p>
Ensure humidity is 55%-75%. Lightly mist the roving/sliver as it enters the spinner. 
<p>
Ensure the set screws are tight on the motor shaft couplers. 
<p>
Loosen the nuts on the trailing wheels. Check for fiber buildup along bearings.
<p>
Draft the roving/sliver to a smaller diameter.
