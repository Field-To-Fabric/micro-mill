#### Skills

You will need to have basic woodworking skills and know how to use the power tools listed above safely. 
Some experience of wiring electronics would also be helpful!

#### 1. Woodworking

###### 1.1 Legs and bearing holders

> Soft wood
> Screws
> Mitre saw
> Impact driver
> Pencil
> Tape measure

1. First measure all the pieces of soft wood you will need for four legs, four sides to the base, two pillow block holders and four bearing holder supports
2. Cut them to length using the mitre saw
3. Screw the base together in a retangle and then attach the legs
4. Flip it the right way around
5. Attach the pillow block holders to thier supports
6. Only attach one pillow block holder and save the other to the side

###### 1.2 Frame and case

> Soft wood 
> Plywood 
> Screws 
> Mitre saw 
> Table saw 
> Impact driver
> Pencil
> Tape measure

1. Measure out all the soft wood struts to make up the frame and the plywood sides and top of the case
2. Cut the struts to size using the mitre saw and the sides and top using the table saw
3. Screw together the frame first and attach to the base
4. Then screw on the plywood sides and top leaving off one side (the side with the missing pillow bloack holder)

##### 1.3 Drums

> Plywood
> Hardwood
> Bolts
> Bolt inserts
> Heckling Combs
> Wood glue
> Thicknesser
> Table Saw
> Drill
> Drill mount
> Pillar Drill
> Forcener bit
> Angle Grinder
> Pencil
> Jig saw
> Measureing tape
> Mitre
> Alluminium boss and scrap wood for making jigs

1. Make the jig. The wheels are made perfectly round with a 30mm hole directly in the centre by using a few clever techniques including a jig that allows a circle to be cut on the table saw. The jig is composed of a cylindrical piece of aluminium (Mark calls it “The Boss” ) the same diameter as the axel (30mm) and slightly longer than the width of the ply we’re cutting (*look up ply width). The Boss has two holes drilled in it and it is screwed into a scrap sheet of plywood which is slightly longer than the diameter of the wheel, and at a distance (10 ¾”) from the edge slightly under the radius of the wheel we’re trying to create (11” because it must fit inside an oil drum which are made to imperial sizes). This allows the wheel to hang over the edge of the jig and rotate on the spot with the centre of the axel hole exactly 11 inches from the saw blade.
2. Cut squares of plywood on the table saw ½” bigger than the wheel diameter. We’re making 22” wheels and cut 22 ½” squares.
3. Mark out the centre and circumference of the wheels. Use a ruler and pencil to find the centre from where the two diagonals meet. Make a trammel from a thin scrap of wood batt or card and make two holes in it at the same distance as the radius of the wheel. Screw into one hole at the centre of the plywood square, and insert a pencil in the other hole. Rotate around to draw your wheel circumference.
4. Cut out the wheel using a jigsaw a couple of mm away from the pencil line.
5. Cut out the axel hole using a forcener bit the same size at the axel (30mm). Attach the forcener bit to the drill and the drill to the stand. Use the “brad” (the spike in the centre of the forcener) to line up the drill with the centre of the wheel and screw the drill stand into the wood. Then drill out the axel hole, using steady pressure and remember to stop and clear out shavings and sawdust several times so it doesn’t get clogged. Don’t drill a big hole in the workbench, do it on a scrap sheet of ply.
6. Place the wheel on the jig and the jig on the table saw. Position the fence so that the centre of the axel hole is exactly the wheel radius away from the cutting edge of the saw blade. Slowly rotate the wheel and the saw will trim it to the exact diameter you want.
