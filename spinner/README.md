# Spinner

There are different variants for the spinner depending on what fibre you are spinning.

All these spinners are derived from [Studio Hilo's](https://gitlab.opensourceecology.de/verein/projekte/cab/hilo-spinning-machine)
original design. Some of the 3D models are taken from their repo and copied here for ease of use (we indicate when
models are taken from the Hilo repo). Some of the models are also designed by Jordon Masters of University of West Virginia
Farm to Fashion.
