# Drafter

The drafting machine is intended for drafting (and doubling) sliver and roving to prepare it for spinning. We expect many add-ons and light modifications to support different fibre types.

## Tools
- M5 spanner
- Hex allen keys
- vice
- clamps
- bearing pusher (like for skateboards?)
- Screwdriver

## Parts

- 30x30 aluminium extrusion for frame
- angle brackets for fixing frame 
- 4 x 300mm threaded M8 rods
- 8 x 10-24 UNC 3 inch bolts (or equivalent size)
- 
- 8 x M8 pillow blocks (42mm spacing between the fixing holes)
- 4 x M5x40mm nut and bolt (for fixing motor)
- 8 x M5x14mm bolt and t-nut (fixing motor mount and pillow mount to extrusion)
- 8 x M8 lock nut (for fixing driven roller and top roller)
- 2 x 6mm to 8mm motor coupling
- 8 x 8mm bore bearing
- 8 x 3D printer bed levelling springs (to fit on 10-24 bolts)

## Specialist Parts
- 2 x drafter cots

## 3D Models
- 2 x Stepper mount
- 2 x pillow block mount
- 2 x Drive wheel
- 4 x Trailing wheel for cot

## Assembly
* Assemble the aluminium extrusion frame. The two long bars should be spaced 165mm apart. They must be stack on two layers of extrusion (60mm high).
* Attach the stepper mount to extrusion
* Screw driven roller on to threaded rod leaving 3cm clear at one end. Fasten in place on both sides using a lock nut
* Sand down the trailing wheels for cot until you can push them into the drafter cot - it should be a (very) tight fit!
* Place a bearing in each trailing wheel and insert onto the rod (placement on the rod is not so important as it can be adjusted later). Place another bearing either side of the cot (acting as 
spacer) and then fix in place with a lock nut. The cot should be able to rotate freely.
* Place 2 10-24 screws from the bottom up through the holes on the stepper mount and fasten with a nut.
* Stack 2 pillow-block through the bolts.
* Place a spring over each bolt and fix in place with a washer and nut.
* Repeat for all stepper and pillow block mounts and
