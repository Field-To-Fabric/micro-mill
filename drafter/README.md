# Drafter

The drafting machine is intended for drafting (and doubling) sliver and roving to prepare it for spinning. We expect many add-ons and light modifications to support different fibre types.

## Tools
- M5 spanner
- Hex allen keys
- vice
- clamps

## Parts

- 30x30 aluminium extrusion for frame
- angle brackets for fixing frame 
- 4 x 300mm threaded M8 rods
- 8 x 10-24 UNC 3 inch screws
- 8 x M8 pillow blocks
- 4 x M5x40mm nut and bolt (for fixing motor)
- 8 x M5x14mm bolt and t-nut (fixing motor mount and pillow mount to extrusion)
- 4 x M8 lock nut (for fixing driven roller)
- 2 x 6mm to 8mm motor coupling

## 3D Models
- Stepper mount
- Drive wheel
- Trailing wheel for cot

## Assembly
* Assemble the aluminium extrusion frame. The two long bars should be spaced 165mm apart. They must be stack on two layers of extrusion (60mm high).
* Attach the stepper mount to extrusion
* Screw driven roller on to threaded rod leaving 3cm clear at one end. Fasten in place on both sides using a lock nut
